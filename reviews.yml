    Fun, original, and clever Woody Allen flick.  Very
    re-watchable.

    Absolute cult-classic!  Almost a "must-watch", but it's maybe not
    for everyone.  Very "trippy", with an amazing soundtrack
    by Tears For Fears.  Might not have aged all that well, definitely
    a nostalgia factor with this one.
